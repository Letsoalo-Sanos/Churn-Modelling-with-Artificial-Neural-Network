# Churn-Modelling-with-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. The model classifies whether a customer will leave the bank based on various features like geography, credit score, age, balance, and more.
